Udacity Project 5: Teach a Quadcopter How to Fly

In this project, I designed an agent that can fly a quadcopter, focusing on the landing task. The agent was trained using the Actor-Critic reinforcement learning algorithm, which was a combination of both value-based(critic) and policy-based(actor) methods.

Details of the hyperparameters as well as the network architecture can be found here.
