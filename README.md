Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree: Teach a Quadcopter How to Fly using Reinforcement Learning

In this project, I designed an agent that can fly a quadcopter, focusing on the landing task. The agent was trained using the Actor-Critic reinforcement learning algorithm, which was a combination of both value-based(critic) and policy-based(actor) methods.

Details of the hyperparameters as well as the network architecture can be found [here](https://github.com/Tushar16759/Quadcopter-Automation-Using-Reinforcement-Learning/blob/master/Quadcopter_Project.ipynb).
